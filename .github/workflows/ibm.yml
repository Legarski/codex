The job failed because the CLA Assistant GitHub Action could not find the branch cla-signatures, which is required to store contributor signatures. The error message also notes that the branch should not be protected.

**Solution:**

1. **Create the required branch:**  
   - Go to your repository and create a new branch named `cla-signatures` from your default branch.
   - Make sure the branch is not protected (i.e., it allows pushes from the workflow).

2. **Check branch protection rules:**  
   - If the branch exists but is protected, go to **Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules**.
   - Remove or adjust the protection rules for `cla-signatures` so that the bot can push to it.

3. **Update workflow if needed:**  
   - Ensure your `.github/workflows/cla.yml` does not restrict access or reference a different branch name for signatures.

**Example: How to create the branch locally and push:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b cla-signatures
git push origin cla-signatures
```

After these steps, re-run the workflow. This should resolve the error:
> Error occurred when creating the signed contributors file: Branch cla-signatures not found. Make sure the branch where signatures are stored is NOT protected.

Let me know if you need more help with the workflow file or branch settings!
